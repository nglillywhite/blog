    "\n",
    "This is an unordered collection of thoughts and observations I've derived after joining a wonderful startup called BioScout in early 23'. This is partly the reason for the lack of writing since my previous posts as I've been very engrossed in our mission as well as my personal day to day life only providing me oxygen to write very recently.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm writing this for twofold reasons, one as a marker for myself after a couple of years to denote the things I've learned; hopefully in a few years I can look back and either laugh or be proud of my shortsightedness or sage thinking at this time. Secondly for anyone else who's thinking about joining a startup, is curious from the outside, I hope this can serve as some insight into what it's like inside a startup. I would have appreciated some longer-form reading like this before I had joined BioScout (or a similar company) to get a sense of what I was stepping into, or maybe I wouldn't have made the same decision, stepping in blind was maybe an important leap of faith for myself."

    " - Jeremy Howard & Rachel Thomas | fast.ai\n",
    "    - Jeremy and Rachel have continued to play such an important north star for me of the kind of data practitioners (and people) I aspire to be. They work on what matters, they share generously, they think hard about what they're doing, and they are always open to change. Their writing and technical work I am forever in-debted to, I also believe their work on nbdev was substantially responsible for me landing my role @ BioScout which has been one of the best decisions I've ever made (note I think luck deserves a huge amount of credit here rather than my foresight).\n",
    "- Lewis, Tony, Tom | BioScout\n",
    "    - For taking a chance on me joining BioScout, I am forever grateful for everything I've got to experience, I'm confident it's changed the trajectory of my life in such a positive way, and I've met such wonderful people. It's been overwhelmingly joy filled at BioScout, and I've learnt more in two years than a decade at a larger institution.\n",
    "- Malcolm\n",
    "    - For giving me the push to make a change which lead to BioScout, for similarly being generous with your thoughts, time, advice, and example to live by. Your leadership and perspective is incredibly influential on me and consciously or unconsciously I'm sure I'm modelling and evaluating myself by the example you put forward.\n",
    "- Everyone @ BioScout | Departed & Current\n",
    "    - I believe massively in what we're doing, I've never been at such a talent dense organisation of such diversity. Especially for those that have departed, even before my time here, thankyou for everything you put into the people and place, we stand on your shoulders, and I know that every person played an important part in us even getting to where we are. I am lucky and proud to be able to do such fundamentally interesting work across so many interesting domains, having biology, mechatronics, agriculture, AI, all under the same warehouse is a truly special thing, I don't know how many of these experiences, if any more in my career I'll actually get to enjoy so I'm savouring the one I've got."

    "## Why I Left a Comfy ASX 5 Job\n",
    ">A brief story on why I left for a startup, and framing for what I've learnt\n",
    "\n",
    "When I was at a large ASX 5 bank, I had a lot of creature comforts, I knew the company wasn't going anywhere, I got to work with really smart people, it's an endlessly interesting and deep domain, and I got to learn about structured work at scale. Of course this all comes with it's own suite of negatives but anyone who complains about a well paying job at a big business which isn't sending you insane I think needs to get a reality check. Your quality of life is generally excellent and there's an enormous amount of worries and concerns which are simply removed from your life.\n",
    "\n",
    "However these big companies **are** insane in the way they work. In a **_bank_**, people will unironically say you can't do something because 'we don't have the money', and well paid, well educated people will all nod in agreement that this is sound judgement. In a place that keeps all the money for society, saying we can't afford a software license to speed up work, or a new laptop, for whatever reason, is brainless speech at best. If you're in these big companies, its important you go into work each day **knowing** it doesn't make any sense how it works, and spend your days fixing these crazy and unthoughtful rules and processes that have been placed before you.\n",
    "\n",
    "However after ~5 years (which is a particularly lucky/long run after being a graduate, I had great people leading me), I got worried that I'd only be capable of working inside these behemoths, and more worryingly, I met people who had acquired what I would consider brain worms or some sort of zombie virus which had convinced them that this big company was totally functional and 'made sense'. The worry that I might catch this virus put the fear of god in me and I realised if there was anytime to figure out if I could survive somewhere else was only going to get harder the longer I waited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Malcolm (My 2-up and mentor for my entire tenure) giving me the tap on the shoulder to think about doing something else, and this fear, were the catalysts to change roles and look for something new, in particular something different than just another big behemoth. Moving from one of the largest companies in the country in finance, to a small startup in agriculture felt like the biggest domain & size leap I could imagine, if I could survive that, I could survive anywhere, it was a fly or die leap.\n"

    "## Everyone Has to Paddle\n",
    "> Don't Point, Do\n",
    "\n",
    "At ~25 people, or whatever your small-ish company is, those who ship code, talk to customers, make payroll happen, sell, and solve problems in the field are all that matter, they paddle the boat. Anyone spending their time overly planning, designing, and pointing at what needs to be done? They're being barnacles on your hull, figure out how to get them paddling; I myself have been a barnacle at times, and helpful feedback has got me focused on paddling again.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example that comes to mind is worrying about a multi-year product vision, when the backlog could be better with a couple of hours hard focus. Don't chart out a huge map of where the boat needs to go in the next 3 years when you need to focus on patching the leaks and helping paddle, there's too few people, and too many leaks. You're so dynamically shifted by the short term seas ahead of you, make sure you have concrete plans for the next month, a pretty good idea of the next 100 days, and a soft vision for the year, more than that is too much to be effective. Your domain expert \"do'ers\" will know the important challenges ahead, your sales team will know what customers are screaming for. Everyone needs to be in the arena, getting their hands dirty. When someone's main contribution is telling others what to do rather than doing it themselves, you feel the drag immediately, and you need to raise this as a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "An easy mistake is to write-off 'non paddlers' too easily, spot the barnacle and be done with it, however, often people want to paddle, they just might have not learnt how to, especially at a weird thing like a startup, it might be as simple as helping them see the part of the boat they need to care about. It's very easy to get distracted with other parts of the boat and neglect your own area of expertise. Often people are coming from big companies (exactly like I did) and working on a super tanker at a place like that is a totally different beast, fundamentally its a separate muscle to work and grow; People often have the capacity to paddle that you want, but joining a new company is hard and helping newbies, or even helping the old-guard break their habits is a big part of bringing people along for the mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could still get better at pointing vs doing, I'm not saying I've solved this equation, but it's taught me that at this scale, \"doing\" is essential. The paddlers keep you afloat, doing anything else risks the boat sinking. When you're all paddling hard, the sails are full, when the wins come, you are completely rushed with endorphins about the rocketship you're on, you realise you're doing something special, and you'll be hungry for the next big 'transformation' the company goes through. It's incredibly bonding and special to achieve these things with other passionate people and I wouldn't change it for the world."

    "> It's OK to not 'Know'\n",
    "\n",
    "In a startup, especially one doing something novel, you can't see what's ahead, that's ok! This is what makes the whole thing fun, don't let it freak you out. It's easy to get caught up in the fun of it all, look out to sea, realise you can't see land, and have that anxiety waterfall wash down your spine into your belly, but let it pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fix isn't pretending you know the way, it's getting comfortable making calls with incomplete data. **Senior leaders especially** need to model this, it absolutely kills me when those running the whole show inappropriately broadcast how panicked they are. Everyone else in the company has less agency, less power, less choice, and you're telling them you're worried? What on earth are they supposed to feel and think, and they're without all the privileges of leadership you're blessed with. Make the best decision you can with what you have, adjust when you learn more, and keep moving, paralysis kills faster than a wrong turn you can correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also totally ok to actually be freaking out and to talk to your peers about it, they might be as well, and you can relinquish the breath you're holding, find a solution, and overcome what you're worried about. Don't let the worry consume you, I know its scary being in a startup, but its so special and rare to even get the opportunity, cherish it, and turn the adrenaline into action, paddle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your team needs to see you navigate ambiguity, not fear it. When leaders own uncertainty without anxiety, it gives everyone permission to move forward despite the fog, it engenders so much trust in your judgement and people will follow you with confidence into big swells and thick fog, it's powerful to lead people through uncertainty. You won't always be right, but you'll be moving, learning, and adjusting, which is the only way to find your way through.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you worry about things you can control, notably the processes and outputs you're responsible for and help the people you can. **Make your circle of concern match your agency**. If you're panicking about the weather, or market conditions that you can't control, there's nothing that can save you, you must accept your limits, wash from your mind these 'uncontrollables', they're taking up valuable space in your limited capacity for stress and problem solving. Most importantly focus on the high value work that **only** you can do, don't obsess over other teams or domains, always contribute where you think you can help but don't try to design hardware you don't understand, or 'own' a product you don't/can't build, do the magic that makes you a witch or wizard.\n"

    "> (As an Engineer), It's the 'growthiest' thing I've ever done\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm confident that I grew more in the first 6 months than maybe the prior 1.5yrs at my prior role, I got squeezed in every way I'd never been squeezed before, and most of 'the things that mattered' at my prior role were barnacle behaviour, or [bikeshedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality), we will talk about this in a later topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes I encountered stress and worry during this first chunk of time, but through every trial I emerged a better professional and person, whilst having an enormous amount of fun. I had/have wonderful, smart people to work with, you have to make magic with extremely limited capacity and resourcing, but you do it, and nothing has ever been as satisfying as the successes and growth we've experienced as a group of people on a mission together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The squeezes are from making sure that everything you do each day is tangible, it makes a difference to the product, or is building to a big bang, step-wise change in capabilities for the business. Any 'barnacling' about making plans you likely don't need, overstructuring your backlog, and not doing the gritty important hard work was immediately tested and weighed, this I had not experienced before. In a big corp, you can have a project that was supposed to be delivered last year, and you can unironically say your sprint is 'on-track', and others will agree with you. You can miss huge deadlines and the company will be fine, however in a startup, these deadlines can genuinely be life or death, you may have an incoming increase in service throughput, and if you have no way to satify that with your technology, you die, plain and simple. This consequential, and non-trivial adversity hones your attention, hones your effort, and makes the wins genuinely phenomenal. In a big company, wins can be very 'whatever' and holding yourself to higher standards is often up to your own volition, or some small subcommunity of high performers which you may be a part of.\n",
    "\n",
    "At BioScout I've met more interesting people from more walks of life than I ever would have expected in such a short time period, often in larger companies, if you're a software engineer, you talk to other software engineers that went to the same schools as you and did similar stuff to you. Everyday I'm in the same room as mechatronics experts, doctorate biologists have decades of spore knowledge, amazing viticulturalists, almost everyone is multi-lingual and most days there's cuisines and culture flooding from around the planet just because people are generous and sharing about their worlds. Working on your passion, around other passionate people, sharing different domains and culture, with a common mission, is a rare and beautiful experience which I'd recommend to anyone"

    "Carl Sagan - \"If I finish a book a week, I will read only a few thousand books in my lifetime, about a tenth of a percent of the contents of the greatest libraries of our time. The trick is to know which books to read.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Carl Sagan is one of the goats and this simple quote illustrates my point better than I can, even given an extraordinary output capacity, it doesn't even scratch the surface of potential efforts available to you, focus on doing _only_ the most important thing at all times. It's likely that at any given time you'll have 20 things you can think of to do that would help the business in a given year. You probably will only have capacity to complete 3, maybe 4, the most important job **_everyone_** has is making sure they're picking the best of the 20. The difference between #1 and #2 might be a 10x in output, imagine the total waste of working on #13 and #8 instead. Don't stress for a moment that you can't increase your capacity to 20 tasks, that's not the objective, do not focus on raw output, you'll just burnout and you won't do what matters!\n",
    "\n",
    "I know that it's _really_ hard to have the discipline to not focus all the time on 'urgent' unimportant work, ([see the eisenhower matrix](https://arahr.com/_next/static/media/the-eisenhower-matrix.6cb39121.png)) you'll be stunned how often urgent isn't actually urgent, and important isn't actually important, you will get many requests to work on #18 and #12 because someone just called to say they're big problems and we 'have to do something right now'; despite the fact that solving #1 and #2 would eliminate these scenarios entirely. I'm not saying don't be tactical, if a huge nuke goes off, drop tools for whatever you're doing and go cleanup the fallout, but humans are humans and they'll tell you there's nukes going off when theres dead flies in the windowsill. Proper workflow management like not flooding your sprint with inbound tasks immedietly (even if they're 1 pointers, the context switching costs you a bomb) and having short but reasonable lockouts for completing planned work is critical, if you can't promise 10 days of work, you're completely sunk, rip the emergency cord and fix this immedietly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The one thing that panics me most about this it that no one talks about opportunity cost for what it is, everyone is focused on increasing capacity, or penny pinching and being pound foolish. Spending half a day to save $19 on a SaaS subscription is _literally_ going backwards because of your salary cost **ONTOP OF** all the things you could have done in that time, **_double penalty_**!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a great reflection moment to take stock and think about if you actually know what is important, if you are 'iffy' on why you've picked #1 and #2, and its hard to tell if #6 or #4 are just as good, talk to your senior leaders, go grab the CEO for coffee and figure out what actually matters. It's very easy to get obsessed over internal metrics or 'resume driven development' by working on cool stuff relative to your domain, and actually that's all fluff to the rest of the company, no one cares if your neural net architecture is state of the art if it doesn't change the service to the customer.\n",

Putting your hands up and saying 'my hands are tied' in almost any scenario is insane to me, don't accept a day of meetings and say \"**I** can't get anything done today\", you're choosing to go to every last one of these conversations. You have legitimate capacity constraints, and demand may be outstripping this, but this will simply _always_ be the case at a startup, no matter if you're double or triple the size you are, spend the effort on being deliberate with **your** time, it's not anyone elses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't do stuff because it looks or smells good, you're putting holes in the ship and jeapardising the beautiful, rare, precious opportunity that is your startup. Maybe the trick will work for a bit but you'll get caught out soon enough and whether its spoken about or not, people will get fed up; its not in your interests, just don't do it. A classic example of 'busy work' that also has the allure of importance is working on 'strategy' or 'frameworks', everyone knows they're very serious words and you must be a very serious person to be thinking 'strategically'. I get it, you can avoid doing the 'gritty' work like cleaning up data in the CRM, calling a customer, pushing a sale, writing material you know you need to. It's a 'smart' way of procrastination, and a good trick to pull on yourself, you can go home and know you're a strategic visionary, 'product minded', and a 'senior' leader.\n",

I will bet a good chunk of money that basically everyone (including me) is not being scrupulous enough with the time budget they have. The irony this produces is that the most effective teams, doing the most with the little, are often invested in the least, because they're making magic on a shoestring, and the noisy, timewasting domains, demand more resources and people. You can drastically increase your capacity and output by being more effective with that time, and saying no to things. You can't make more hours in the week, stop trying to, and stop making excuses for not getting things done, I certainly think you're an un-serious person if these excuses are genuinely brought up as reasons why things don't get done, and you should too.\n",

Just make sure you've got some conviction about how you want your day and week to pan out, if you're swayed by the wind, and then you put your hands up in panic saying \"you're busy\", change something, there's nothing in you way, even if it's your leadership, manage up, that's still in your wheelhouse."

Getting 'stuck' in your ways is a form of mental barnacles that I'm always trying to shed, new people and a change in environment can help you shake these off, but it's something to really pay attention to. One of the paradigm shifting experiences for me at BioScout has been hearing direct feedback, sometimes twice or three times, I'm no saint. It may have been about what objective I should deliver on instead of my current focus or a piece of communication that wasn't effective, making a choice, and seeing the fruits both personally and for those around me is fantastically satiating.

Take advantage of this pace of play and try stuff out, it's kind of _mandatory_ that you try new things at a startup, otherwise you won't make it, so steering into this skid is an important emotional and mental commitment to make.

    ">**~\"To be a tech founder requires a whole lot of arrogance, you need the arrogance to believe that you can actually build something other people are going to want to buy, and other people who will come to compete with you won't do as well as you, you need the arrogance to believe that you can win, which is a lot of arrogance. But you also need the humility to realise that other people come along and have better ideas than you and you should sometimes borrow those ideas. It requires this weird combination of great humility and great arrogance, and in Australia people mainly notice the arrogance.\"**\n",

    " I agree and have experienced the sentiment in Australia that people generally poo-poo people having a go, despite 'having a fair go' being an idiom the nation and its politicians recognise as a core trait. There's something about trying to do something 'new' that we really try to cut down and I think that's awful.\n",

    "Don't be afraid of having a crack, its the whole point of startups, don't worry about being arrogant, it's partly a requirement of being part of the 'having a crack' crowd. Secondly don't let the fear of your step out into the open being your demise, it's also a cost of doing business when you're trying to do something new, know that these are innately facets of the nature of working on these kinds of problems and that the cost is totally worth it. This extends to your team as well, if you're going to bolster a belief in yourself that you can do these things, believe in them strongly as well, one of the most profound experiences for me has been this trust at BioScout. Whether it was talked about or not, and whether I was even comfortable with this fact at the time, I was handed the keys and some pretty dire consequences if I didn't figure out a whole bunch of novel things quite quickly, but with the amazing people around me trusting me to 'do the magic', I came up with the goods. There's been a few other circumstances where I've noticed other people are put in these positions and when we as a team 'back' them to do the same, we've completely transformed as a business, and people start coming up with magic, this is powerful stuff.\n",

Deep down, 'knowing' you can actually make it as a firm is a fire you must tend to and keep warm, if this fizzles to embers, this is a dire prognosis for your purpose and you need to get the bellows or do something else, not keeping hot embers is also contagious and the 'down' mood can plague the whole office."

    " Culture is a very real, intangible, hard to measure, and impactful facet to work on, and you have to consciously work on it harder than you think you should, I also promise it pays huge dividends. I fundamentally believe one of the most important things BioScout does each year is the camping trip, it's kind of impossible to not relax a bit after a few days at the beach snorkelling together, and that comfort pays idea coupons for the rest of the year. Who wouldn't take the trade of a 3 day investment for ~230 days of improved effectiveness across the whole company, I'd take that trade."

    "This is a short note on hiring, every single 'brilliant' person we've hired had oodles of the right 'attitude' and worked hard, when these people also had talent, they're absolute monsters which we need to golden handcuff. We've had 'talented' people, and we've had people with lots of experience, experience has been the most awful indicator so far of being effective, and I think talent is a pretty good indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "The right attitude will be very particular to your firm and what you need as a group, for us it's always been enthusiasm for the mission & ego-less help and work ethic. In our particular situation, everything else we can teach or comes easy but it's impossible to get someone to be generous with their work and be excited about what we're doing if they're not already of that disposition. We've had people come through with years of experience and they've spent their entire tenure on 'strategic thinking', 'vision' work, or finger pointing what needs to be done, instead of paddling themselves. We've also been lucky to have incredibly talented people come through but who were also fickle with their efforts, both scenarios have proven themselves not good long term contributors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The title algorithm is my current opinion on the balance of power between this facets but this is a very counter-intuitive balance from what I would have thought before going through so much hiring myself, I certainly assumed experience and talent would tell a bigger part of the story, and its certainly not what recruiters and lots of people seem to spend effort on."

Simply put we would have not been able to operate the business going forward and I can't imagine the company would have had any real path to survival. With some cool stop-gaps such as filtering our imagery for 'high signal' images to label, and ultimately some big new computer vision AI which was totally autonomous, we went from hurting at ~10 units, to basically having an infinite capacity for throughput, this really reset the emotional space of the company and was a huge notch on my belt personally, I'd proven to myself I can 'do' this in a new space, and the direct connection to the company changing was a chemical high I had not experienced professionally before, I've been hunting this ever since.\n",

But at the time I got feedback that this was some berlin wall like demolishment and people then immediately felt safer to also talk about their fires and worries. This leads back to the culture point of everyone having an influence, and whether spoken or not, people are observant and morph their behaviour to the average of principles they are exposed to.\n",

It's also very easy to assume that no one is interested in 'your' thing, and actually its the opposite, usually everyone is clamouring to understand everyone elses domain but people don't invest in sharing or inviting people into their space.
