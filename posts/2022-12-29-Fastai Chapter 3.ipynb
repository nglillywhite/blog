    "This chapter focuses on understanding the absolute bare bones fundamentals of how deep learning works. In particular the individual calculations that are being done at each and every 'artificial neuron' of any deep learning network that we build. I'm certainly not from a math background and am generally intimidated but intrigued by learning math like this. I think I have shaky foundational math understanding but I'm hoping working through this course in great detail will bolster these core concepts and I can build on them. Despite my enjoyment of math in school, I did only the general curriculum in my final two years because the math teachers in my school were able to induce a coma purely via the audio of their voice. I have no doubt they were well intentioned people but many were phoning in the days and I wasn't willing to spend half of my school day with them. I'm paying the price for it now having to re-learn these concepts but maybe its for the best, if they'd explained that $y=mx+b$, derivatives, and quadratics could detect cancers and make self driving cars I probably would have been a more passionate student. I feel very much a product of the \"[Mathematician's Lament](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf)\" that is referenced in chapter 1 of the book. Its a lovely read and I took many lessons away from the write-up, not only in how I want to teach things going forward but also a strong emotional response to how something as incredible as math is ruined and tarnished because of how its taught. Think of where we could be, but nonetheless this blog is about chapter 3 of the fastai course, not math education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless here I am, and in the spirit of the \"Sidebar: Tenacity and Deep Learning\" from the book, I'm hoping that writing this blog and working through the content is a explicit evidence of success for me being both tenacious, and re-learning my math roots.\n",

    "## Main Topics\n",

    "The main concepts I want to have a 'mechanistic' & intuitive feeling for after this chapter are:\n",

    " - ReLu\n",
    " - Matrix Multiplication\n",
    " - Tensors\n",
    " - Gradient Descent\n",
    " \n",
    "Hopefully after reading this blog you also feel comfortable with these important tools and feel as comfortable as I intend to be implementing and discussing these core concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the lecture, this chapter has different content in the book from the lecture and I'd like to work through both, I'm firstly going to follow along the lecture with Jeremy and re-write & create the functions and tools he builds, barring the excel work which I'd like to re-write in python here, I will then work through the book content."

We shall step all the way down to a leaf, take particular note of the branch names contained within the smooth brackets '()'. First we go via the \"Layer1\" layer, into the first BasicBlock which has the notation of '(O)', I'm guessing because the layer is an array of BasicBlocks, the first index being 0, then I'm going to pick the BatchNorm2d submodule which has the notation of '(bn1)' within the brackets."

Maybe I'll revisit this later or what I'm guessing is that we will discuss batch normalisation as part of the course. Nonetheless, credit due to the pytorch team for awesome docs and references.

    "The [python docs themselves are quite useful](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.partial) at describing partials. For example, \"Return a new partial object which when called will behave like *func* called with the positional and keyword arguments.\"\n",

    "Side note, the book \"Fooled by Randomness\" and \"Black Swan\" by Nassim Taleb are genuinely inspiring works that made me think and behave about and in the world differently. In particular Nassim introduces the concept of these 'invisible' generators that create the randomness in our world, the main problem is that we only ever observe a sample from these generators. Despite 'long' time frames relative to our lives, ie having data over 20 years, that simply might be an insufficient sample from the 'generator' to make any worthwhile inference of what the actual likelihood of your observations actually are. Irrelevant to the python we're writing right now but when imaginging this hypothetical world where we observe this perfect function but only see a noisy version, I thought I'd share some of my favourite books."

    "At this point it should be clear that you can muck around with these variables to fit this function line to our data depending on the a,b,c terms. We can manually play around with them and see the MSE or loss function improve or get worse. When doing this by hand, its a manual activity and we're checking the number go up or down but if we wanted to 'Arthur Samuel' style automate this process, we can use derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that I have understood derivates previously is that they help you explain the 'rate of change' for a function at any point. This relates to the gradient of a point on the curve since the gradient will tell me for any point on a function how much y will change if I change x, but because we don't have a linear function, this gradient changes a lot as we move along the curve. Derivatives let me figure out this gradient at any point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is a naive and likely wrong way of explaining derivatives, its just me writing out my thoughts and shaky foundations as they are currently. However the high level concept of derivatives being 'a way of knowing the correct direction to change a value in order to minimise our loss' is the important bit and I'm fairly confident that I'm not too wrong there. Take my explanations with a grain of salt as I am but this is the current nuance of how I think about derivatives, and gradients in relation to functions and minimising losses\n",
    "\n",
    "Pytorch will calculate these gradients for us so we reliably can always know how to change our parameters in order to improve our loss function. I feel like we're starting to see the symphony of concepts come together here."

    "Ok we're now playing with tensors again, and there's two important things to note, firstly how many dimensions our tensor has, in this case only 1 as we can only move along one dimension of the tensor. Unlike a 2D tensor like a dataframe where we could move along rows and columns, and a 3D tensor where we could move along columns, up or down rows, and depth-wise into different 'slices' of this dataframe. Hopefully that feels comfortable of the dimensions of a tensor. The other important note here is we are calling a *requires_grad_()* function which has an important *_* after the function name, this means to do the operation 'inplace' or on the object we're calling it with. If we call the function without the *_* it will return the output of the function but to a new object instead of the object we used to call the function, I'll show you below."

Who gets up in the morning and thinks of doing deep learning in excel?! Then again, he's got some deep (pun not indended but very much enjoyed) programming roots in APL and S which are kind of the roots of excel and Jeremy was doing deep learning in the 90s so it doesn't surprise me he natively thinks in this array programming style. Who knew consultants, accountants, etc are all just huge functional programming fans, the OOP vs functional factional wars continue and people don't even know they're fighting the war.\n",

If you're reading this I haven't yet come back to revisit this part and re-implement the excel work, feel free to either remind me or be patient as I likely will come back and pythonify the amazing example that Jeremy works through, maybe we'll even use a new dataset."

    "We're going to wind back the clock to 1998 when the \"National Institute of Standards and Technology\" or 'NIST' collected ~60,000 training and ~10,000 testing images of hand written digits and MNIST was born. One of the most famous datasets in all of machines learning, the 'M' in MNIST comes from the \"Modified\" word since the original creators mixed the training and test samples together since NIST originally took their training samples from a different cohort (American Census Bureau Employees) to their training sample (American High School Students). [Thanks Wiki for the history lesson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), in the same year, Yann Lecun and his colleagues used a Neural Net named \"Lenet-5\" to demonstrate accurate recognition of the handwritten pictures. [Checkout this video of \"Lenet-1\"](https://youtu.be/FwFduRA_L6Q) which Yann states is \"the first convolutional network that could recognise handwritten digits with good speed and accuracy.\" Its honestly bonkers seeing how amazing this tech was back in 93 yet it still took another couple of decades to hit mainstream & for the brilliance to be recognised. Its amazing watching these absolute gangsters in this random basement build history making software like its nothing.\n",

Lets instead build a baseline for the key reasons the book mentions, you can test your new ideas to see if they are better than your baseline which can be implented almost instantly. You can either try a simple / naive idea or copy down someone elses already implemented solution so you have a starting point for your problem.\n",

Also this little list making magic is called \"List Comprehension\" and similar to one line methods, it gives you a great way of creating lists in one line.[The python docs are excellent](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions) and I recommend a read through if you haven't seen this before."

Currently we have a long list of tensors, ie we have a list and each element is a tensor, we can index into the list elements and then into any subset of the pixels of that tensor. We're going to now 'stack' all the list elements into its own dimension so that we have 3 dimensions to index through, instead of one dimension (the list) which then contains the tensors. It should mentally feel like a 'cube' of stacked tensors, where we can slide depth-wise through to each image, and horizontally or vertically to scan within an image.\n",

[Pytorch's broadcast semantics](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/broadcasting.html#broadcasting-semantics) has a decent description of what they're doing, it [appears to be a numpy concept which is well documented here](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.broadcasting.html#general-broadcasting-rules).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to use this with our loss functions since even though we're giving the function a single example, its going to broadcast it 1,010 times to match the 'depth' of our validation tensor. This allows us to compute these sorts of things on the GPU instead of CPU which makes it lightning fast in comparison, torch also does smart things like not allocating extra memory and simply pretending like its of the proper rank without the wasted duplication. Often this will happen in the background and you don't have to explicitly write the broadcasting which makes it simple to write mentally and understand, love your work pytorch gang!"
